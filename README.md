# Vegetable Image Classification
This project is a machine learning model that classifies images of vegetable.
## Dataset Splitting
The dataset is divided into two parts:
* Training Set 
* Validation Set
* Test Set

## Data Augmentation with ImageDataGenerator
* Use Keras' ImageDataGenerator to convert the image into an array of size (150, 150, 3)

## Model Architecture
The model is built using the Transfer Learning method with the MobileNetV2 model.

## Model Performance
* Training Accuracy: 95.87%
* Testing Accuracy: 98.73%

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of transfer learning with the MobileNetV2 architecture for image classification, particularly for classifying various types of vegetables. The use of data augmentation techniques and fine-tuning of the model enabled it to achieve a high accuracy rate on the validation set.
